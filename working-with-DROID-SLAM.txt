DROID-SLAM only works on Linux (to my knowledge). I've tried multiple times on Windows, but none of the methods worked.

I have installed Ubuntu 22.04 with NVIDIA CUDA 12.2. 

!!IMPORTAT NOTE!! You have to install the same CUDA prefix version that your GPU comes with. So, if your GPU comes automatically (by automatically I mean when Ubuntu installs drivers for your PC) with CUDA 12.x, you have to install CUDA from the official site (see useful links down below) with 12.x. Doesn't matter that in the .yaml cuda-toolkit is specified with 11.3 (you will se a message later at setup that says something like "different versions of CUDA detected, but this should not be a problem"). If you install a different CUDA prefix, your Ubuntu will crash completely and you will have to reinstall it.

!!IMPORTANT NOTE!! Ubuntu will have to be installed alongside Windows, so, in dual-boot. There are a ton of tutorials on YouTube, you can search there how to do that. Ubuntu won't work on a virtual machine in applications like VirtualBox.

!!IMPORTANT NOTE!! If you have AMD GPU I am pretty sure this won't work.

Below you have every command needed for the environment setup. Don't install packages using conda because that will take ages. Use conda only for creating the environment and then install everything with pip commands, because it works way faster. Use python 3.9 when creating your environment. You can also use venv directly from the pip package virtualenv for creating the environment, but that is not "stable" as the .bat file will bug in time.

I have this comment as well on GitHub: https://github.com/princeton-vl/DROID-SLAM/issues/115#issuecomment-1851983842




pip install virtualenv    OR     python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

virtualenv -p "path/to/python.exe/of/choice" venvname

I hope you successfully achieved the setup for DROID-SLAM. 
Now it's time to download some datasets and see if it works.
There are links provided in the download_sample_data.sh file, but for more datasets you can search some of them online as well. Here are some links:
https://www.tanksandtemples.org/download/
https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download
https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php
The Barn link does not work, so don't bother, the link is the first one above, the Tanks and Temples.
